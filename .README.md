- run "npm install" before running the application 
- run "node app.js" to run the application
- written the front end part in public (index.html)
- api call to run in the postman - http://localhost:3000/api/evaluate 
- i have tested locally for deployement using vercel command 
    - npm install -g vercel
    - vercel dev


- index.html  #Frontend entry point
- public/     #Static files (e.g., images, favicon, etc.)
- api/             # Serverless functions (backend)
    evaluate.js


- we have used vercel and deployed the complete code directly in vercel 

Serverless Backend with api/ Folder (Vercel Approach)
In serverless architecture, Vercel automatically treats files in the api/ folder as independent serverless functions, which brings specific advantages:

Scalability:

Each function (e.g., api/evaluate.js) runs in isolation and scales automatically with traffic.
No need to manage or monitor a server (server.js).
Separation of Concerns:

Each API endpoint has its own file (e.g., api/evaluate.js), making debugging and updating easier.
No centralized entry point (like server.js).
Improved Performance:

Only the function that's called is executed (e.g., api/evaluate.js), reducing runtime overhead.
No need to load the entire Express app for a single API call.
Native to Vercel:

Vercel is designed to work seamlessly with the api/ folder.
Deploying an Express server (server.js) on Vercel requires workarounds like using vercel.json.
